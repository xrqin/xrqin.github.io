I am fourth-year Ph.D. student working on cryptography in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Tsz Hon Yuen](https://thyuen.github.io/) and [Prof. Siu Ming Yiu](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/smyiu). 

Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in school of Mathematics from [Shandong University](https://en.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2019.

My current focus is on building privacy-preserving protocols for blockchain.
