I am fourth-year Ph.D. student working on cryptography in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Tsz Hon Yuen](https://thyuen.github.io/) and [Prof. Siu Ming Yiu](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/smyiu). 

Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in school of Mathematics from [Shandong University](https://en.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2019.

My passion lies in the intersection of cryptography and blockchain technology. Specifically, I am interested in developing cutting-edge privacy-preserving protocols for blockchain networks. Through my research, I aim to contribute to the creation of a more secure, transparent, and decentralized digital world.
